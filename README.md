# Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQL)

- To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL.

- One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.

- Below are the SQL statements for cleaning and transforming necessary data.
